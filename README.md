# Teensy Encryption Device 
The Teensy Encryption Device (TED) provides a, secure method for encrypting and decrypting data communications sent through a satellite radio communications link, between a satellite and ground station. The module sits between any flight computer and a communications radio.  Below is the source code for our implementation. 

# Performance Characteristics:
* Encryption speed: ~1.0 MB/second 
* Power draw: < 0.4 watts
* Weight: ~3 grams
* Dimensions: 36 mm x 18 mm x 5 mm (without headers)
# Features:
* AES 256 CBC & CTR encryption modes, additional modes possible
* UART (serial) interface, additional interfaces possible
